Game demo where the player aims and shoot projectiles bursts into an increasing number of entities.
After every burst, the entities move up and more are spawned
There is a score counter
After every 10 points (1 points = 1 entity eliminated), the number of projectiles in a burst increases
Game over when 1 entity hits the top of the screen
There is sound for hit, when projectile goes out of the screen, when burst increases
Textures of entities varies every spawn wave
